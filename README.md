# Crystal Quest

## Overview
Crystal Quest is a small 3D puzzel-adventure built in Unity. The player navigates three rooms: 
- Room 1: Find and collect a key to unlock the door. Players can also collect coins to gain scores. 
* Room 2: An outdoor water-platforming challenge. Collect coins (10 points each) to reach 100 points and open the exit. 
+ Room 3: Collect a gun to defeat a monster and obtain a crystal. A toxic gas barrier blocks the path unless the player first finds a gas mask. 
Your goal is to collect the crystal in Room 3 and win the game.
